# Third-Party Integrations Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the third-party integrations (Nextcloud, Zulip, OpenProject) in the platformQ project. Currently, these integrations have minimal implementations that prevent services from delivering their full value.

## Current State

### Nextcloud Client (libs/shared/platformq_shared/nextcloud_client.py)
- **Implemented**: Basic folder creation, file upload
- **Missing**: User management, file operations, sharing, WebDAV, groups, permissions, search, versioning

### OpenProject Client (libs/shared/platformq_shared/openproject_client.py)
- **Implemented**: Basic project creation
- **Missing**: Work packages, user management, types/statuses, memberships, custom fields, attachments, time tracking, queries

### Zulip Client (libs/shared/platformq_shared/zulip_client.py)
- **Implemented**: Basic stream creation
- **Missing**: Messaging, user management, full channel management, subscriptions, presence, webhooks, file uploads, reactions
