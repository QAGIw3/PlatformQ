# Adaptive Neuromorphic-Driven Resource Orchestration

## Overview
This system uses neuromorphic processing for real-time anomaly detection and adaptive scaling across platformQ services.

## Components
- Neuromorphic-service: Detects anomalies and publishes events.
- Flink: Aggregates events.
- Provisioning-service: Handles scaling with Ignite caches.
- Spark: Predicts anomalies.
- Airflow: Executes scaling workflows.

## Flow
1. Events via Pulsar to Flink.
2. Routed to neuromorphic for detection.
3. Anomalies trigger scaling in provisioning.
4. Airflow DAGs adjust resources.
5. Spark predicts future issues.
