# platformQ DAO User Guide

## 1. Introduction to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

This guide provides an overview of how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are integrated into platformQ, enabling community-driven governance for projects and initiatives. DAOs empower users to participate in decision-making processes, shaping the future of the platform.

## 2. Understanding Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in DAOs

Verifiable Credentials play a crucial role in platformQ DAOs by providing cryptographically secure and privacy-preserving attestations of your qualifications, contributions, and rights within the ecosystem. VCs can represent:

*   **Membership Rights**: Proof of your active membership in a specific DAO.
*   **Voting Power**: Your eligibility to vote and the weight of your vote can be tied to specific VCs (e.g., reputation scores, past contributions).
*   **Reputation**: Accumulated reputation based on your on-chain and off-chain activities, attested by VCs.
*   **Attestations of Participation**: Records of your engagement in proposals, votes, or project milestones.

## 3. Participating in platformQ DAOs

### 3.1. Discovering DAOs

platformQ will provide a dashboard to discover active DAOs, view their purpose, and understand their governance models.

### 3.2. Joining a DAO

Joining a DAO might involve fulfilling certain criteria attested by VCs (e.g., minimum reputation score, specific project participation).

### 3.3. Understanding Governance Models

platformQ DAOs can utilize various governance models, including:

*   **Reputation-Based Voting**: Your voting power is dynamically calculated based on your accumulated reputation score, verified by your VCs.
*   **Token-Based Voting**: While not the primary model, certain DAOs might use utility tokens where voting power is proportional to token holdings.
*   **Multi-Signature Approvals**: For critical treasury or contract upgrades, multi-signature wallets (like Gnosis Safe) require a threshold of authorized signers.

## 4. Proposing and Voting on Proposals

### 4.1. Creating a Proposal

Any eligible DAO member can create a proposal. Proposals outline actions or decisions for the DAO to consider, such as funding requests, feature developments, or policy changes. The process will involve:

*   **Defining the Proposal**: Clearly articulating the title, description, and proposed actions.
*   **Attaching Evidence**: Optionally linking Verifiable Credentials as evidence to support your proposal (e.g., VCs proving your expertise or past success in similar initiatives).
*   **Selecting a Voting Strategy**: Depending on the DAO, you might choose from available voting strategies (e.g., simple majority, quadratic voting).

### 4.2. Casting Your Vote

When a proposal is open for voting, you can cast your vote. Your voting power will be determined by your associated VCs.

*   **Reviewing Proposals**: Carefully review the proposal details, discussions, and attached evidence.
*   **Connecting Your Wallet**: Ensure your decentralized identity (DID) is linked to your platformQ account.
*   **Submitting Your Vote**: Choose 'For', 'Against', or 'Abstain'. Your vote is recorded on-chain, and a Verifiable Credential might be issued to attest your participation.

## 5. The Role of Verifiable Credentials in DAO Operations

VCs are integral to the transparent and auditable operation of platformQ DAOs:

*   **On-chain Authorization**: VCs can serve as proof of identity or permissions for interacting with DAO smart contracts.
*   **Reputation Layer**: The `ReputationScoreCredential` directly influences voting power in reputation-based models.
*   **Auditability**: Every key action (e.g., proposal creation, vote casting, treasury expenditure) can be tied to VCs, providing an immutable audit trail.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Participation**: With Zero-Knowledge Proofs, you can prove eligibility or reputation without revealing underlying sensitive data.

## 6. Security Best Practices

*   **Secure Your DID and Wallet**: Your Decentralized Identity and associated private keys are critical. Use strong, unique passwords and consider hardware wallets.
*   **Verify Information**: Always double-check proposal details, smart contract addresses, and any requests for credentials.
*   **Stay Informed**: Keep up-to-date with DAO announcements and security advisories.
