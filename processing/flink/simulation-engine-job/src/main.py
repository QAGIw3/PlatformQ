    # 5. The core logic would be implemented in a custom PyFlink function or a series of SQL transformations.
    #    This logic would:
    #      a. Read the simulation definition from Cassandra when a 'start' event arrives.
    #      b. Initialize N agents based on the 'agent_definitions' table.
    #      c. For each 'tick':
    #         - Read the current state of all agents for a given simulation.
    #         - Apply the 'behavior_rules' for each agent.
    #         - This would produce a new stream of 'agent_action' events.
    #         - A second part of the job would consume these actions, update the agent_states table,
    #           and archive the action to the data lake.
