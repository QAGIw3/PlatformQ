# Digital Asset Service

The `digital-asset-service` is the central registry and source of truth for all Digital Assets within the platformQ ecosystem. It provides a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting asset metadata.

## Core Concepts

A **Digital Asset** is the platform's canonical representation of any piece of data, whether it's a 3D model, a business contact, a simulation log, or a document. This service stores the unified metadata for these assets, while the raw data is typically stored in a more appropriate location (like Nextcloud or an S3-compatible object store).

## Architecture

*   **Database**: This service is backed by a **PostgreSQL** database to robustly handle the relational nature of assets and their links. Database schema changes are managed by **Alembic** migrations located in the `migrations/` directory.
*   **API**: A FastAPI application provides a standard CRUD interface for managing assets.

## API Endpoints

The service exposes the following main endpoints under the `/api/v1/assets` prefix:

*   `POST /`: Creates a new digital asset.
*   `GET /`: Lists all digital assets with pagination.
*   `GET /{asset_id}`: Retrieves a specific asset.
*   `PATCH /{asset_id}`: Updates an asset's properties.
*   `DELETE /{asset_id}`: Deletes an asset.
